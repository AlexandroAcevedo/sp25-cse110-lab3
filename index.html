      <h2>Getting to Know the Team!</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        At the start of the metting, the team took turns introducing themselves with each other
        to apply faces to names. We gave our name, major+year, and a hobby.<b>2</b>members <strong>couldn't attend.</strong>
        We then had a few bits of small talk discussing our classes and schedules.

      <h2>Gaming time!</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        We deicide to play several games such as <i>BombParty</i> and Skribbl. A lot of our members seemed to
        enjoy BombParty as there were <em>explosive and excited</em> reactions to securing a word with seemingly
        impossible letters.

      <h2>Brainstorming Branding</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        After bonding with the team, we set out to get a general idea of what our team branding shold be.
        We discussed first our team mascot and although there was some trouble, we managed to decide on a panda.
        Then this led to our team name being Black Hat White Hat, refering to hackers. This led to development of our
        logo made by Vivian. <img src="Team2Logo.png" alt="Team Logo" width="366" height="410">

      <p>
        This lead to deciding on our theme. Some of the words that popped up were
        Mysterious <br>
        Sleuth <br>
        Professional <br>
        Humor <br>
        We decided to have a mix of professionalism and humor as can be seen with the audio

      <h2>Team Video Plan</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        After securing a base for our team branding, we then went on to discuss the team video
        for the rest of the meeting. We didn't have anyone with prior experience but Alex(me) 
        volunteered to learn and compile the video together. We decided to do a mini talent show
        to showcase a bit of each team member's personality. This is the completed video.
